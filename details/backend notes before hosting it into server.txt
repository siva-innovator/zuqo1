Backends
Human library includes pre-bundled CPU, WASM and WebGL backends, there is no need to load them externally.


Notes
CPU backend usage is not recommended for performance reasons
as TensorFlow implementation in JavaScript is by far the slowest
WebGL backend usage is fastest on systems with modern GPU
although startup speed is a bit slower
WASM backend has good resuts under specific conditions:
Enable WASM SIMD support in your browser
(CPU parallel processing instructions)
Reduce size of input image (e.g. webcam)
as WASM does not have optimized image extraction methods
How to enable WASM SIMD support
Chrome:

Navigate to chrome://flags
WebAssembly SIMD support set to Enabled
Edge:

Navigate to chrome://flags
WebAssembly SIMD support set to Enabled
Firefox:

Navigate to about:config
javascript.options.wasm_simd set to True

Known Issues
WASM backend without SIMD has limited processing capabilities before it causes issues
To avoid issues, start human with most models disabled and if needed, enable them one by one as each initializes
Typical errors messages are:
Uncaught (in promise) Error: undefined tfjs-backend-wasm.wasm or
RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds in tfjs-backend-wasm.wasm
NodeJS backend is missing key operations and thus neither Face nor Hand models are currently supported
