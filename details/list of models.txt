Models
Default models in Human library
Default models in Human library are:

Face Detection: MediaPipe BlazeFace-Back
Face Mesh: MediaPipe FaceMesh
Face Iris Analysis: MediaPipe Iris
Emotion Detection: Oarriaga Emotion
Gender Detection: Oarriaga Gender
Age Detection: SSR-Net Age IMDB
Body Analysis: PoseNet
Face Embedding: BecauseofAI MobileFace Embedding
Notes
Body detection can be switched from PoseNet to BlazePose depending on the use case:

PoseNet: Works with multiple people in frame, works with only partial people
Best described as works-anywhere, but not with great precision
BlazePose: Works with single person in frame and that person should be fully visibile
But if conditions are met, it returns far more details (39 vs 17 keypoints) and is far more accurate
Furthermore, it returns 3D approximation of each point instead of 2D

Gender detection can be switched from the default model to SSR-Net trained on IMDB dataset
